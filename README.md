# Tanks
A two-days-of-development socket.io / Node based web game. Host your node server, port-forward the port, and invite your friends for a game of shoot-each-other-with-tanks-and-gain-points.

All game logic is server-authoritative, so no client-side JavaScript cheating can affect the server-side game state.
